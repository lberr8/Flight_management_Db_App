A Flight Management Database

If using codespaces you need to install sqlite viewer, python and pip install prettytable.
The version of splite in codespaces is older and some functions and options in the newer version (such as STRICT and CONCAT()) do not work.  

Delete flight_management.db file.  Then run the create_flight_management_db.py file, followed by either or both the queries.py or cli_app.py file.
